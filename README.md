Frontend development has become my channel for harmonizing my creative energy toward one refined objective: curating experiences through digital products.

There's no better joy than being part of a team that leaves a meaningful imprint on the greater community.

I'm an artist thru & thru. Design thinking keeps me true! - Welcome ;)
