## My Role
As Founding UX/UI Designer, I:

- Led Figma design and prototyping of Dreamerâ€™s MVP with a focus on accessibility and workflow clarity.

- Collaborated with a 5-person cross-functional team to define user flows and create high-fidelity prototypes.

- Configured and tested low-code/no-code workflows using Bubble.io for rapid MVP iteration.

- Supported user testing and iterative refinement to align the product with user needs.

## What I Built
- High-fidelity Figma prototypes showcasing pilot features and clear user flows.

- Accessible, user-centered design patterns grounded in WCAG guidelines.

- Low-code MVP workflows using Bubble.io for a functional, testable platform.

- Design system foundations to support scalable feature growth post-MVP.

## The Outcome
- Delivered an MVP that enabled Dreamer to secure pilot user testing and initial feedback loops.

- Facilitated iterative refinements based on user testing insights to improve usability and workflow clarity.

- Established a scalable design foundation to accelerate future feature builds.
