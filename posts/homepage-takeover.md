A collaboration between Marketing and Product to determine how best to increase user engagement and donations on CapRadio’s homepage. We A/B tested a modernized pushdown banner against a custom homepage takeover, ultimately driving measurable impact on donation goals.

## My Role
As Front-End Developer, I:

- Translated mockups into a functional, accessible takeover feature.

- Rebuilt the takeover as a full-page pop-up after identifying limitations in the initial structure.

- Ensured compatibility with VWO, aligning technical execution with stakeholder goals.

## What I Built
- Custom homepage takeover built and integrated into the CMS infrastructure.

- Refactored legacy pushdown banners for clean compatibility with VWO’s A/B testing tools.

- Implemented with HTML/CSHTML, CSS/LESS, and Umbraco CMS for seamless deployment and testing.

## The Outcome
- 14% increase in donation button clicks across multiple A/B testing rounds.

- No notable user complaints, validating the approach while supporting CapRadio’s fundraising efforts.
